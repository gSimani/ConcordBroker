## 🔧 Recommended Action

### Option 1: Fix Data Quality Issue (Recommended) 🔴
**File:** `supabase_standardized_industrial_fix.json`
- Corrects 19,434 wrongly standardized properties
- Changes codes 21, 27, 28 from "Industrial" to "Commercial"
- **Impact:** Database integrity improvement, no effect on current filter
- **Time:** ~5-10 minutes to execute

### Option 2: Enhance Industrial Filter (Optional) 🟡
**Enhancement:** Add DOR code filtering to capture more properties
- Current coverage: 16,839 properties (owner patterns)
- Enhanced coverage: 60,000+ properties (DOR codes + patterns)
- **Impact:** +40,000 industrial properties discovered

## 📋 To Answer Your Question:

**"Are we missing Industrial USE or SUBUSE?"**

**Answer:**
1. **SubUse:** ❌ Column doesn't exist in database schema
2. **USE Codes:** ✅ We have all 50,092 properties with official DOR industrial codes (040-049)
3. **Missing Properties:** ⚠️ Current filter misses ~33,000 properties that have DOR industrial codes but generic owner names
4. **Incorrect Data:** 🚨 19,434 COMMERCIAL properties wrongly marked as "Industrial" in standardized_property_use

**Recommendation:**
- Fix the data quality issue (19,434 wrong records)
- Optionally enhance filter to include DOR codes for better coverage
