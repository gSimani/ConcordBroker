# Railway Deployment Checklist

## ‚úÖ Files Fixed and Created

### Root Level Files (Required by Railway)
- [x] `main.py` - Entry point that Railway will execute
- [x] `requirements.txt` - Python dependencies at root level
- [x] `railway.json` - Simplified Railway configuration
- [x] `nixpacks.toml` - Simplified build configuration
- [x] `Procfile` - Simple process definition

## üöÄ Deploy to Railway - Step by Step

### Step 1: Test Locally First
```bash
test-railway-local.bat
```
This will verify all files exist and the server starts locally.

### Step 2: Commit and Push Changes
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "fix: Railway deployment with simplified configuration"
git push origin main
```

### Step 3: Railway Dashboard Configuration

Go to: https://railway.app/project/05f5fbf4-f31c-4bdb-9022-3e987dd80fdb

#### A. Environment Variables (REQUIRED)
Click on "Variables" tab and add:
```
SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_url_here
SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_anon_key_here
SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=your_service_role_key_here
PORT=8000
PYTHON_VERSION=3.10
```

#### B. Deploy Settings
Click on "Settings" tab and verify:
- Repository: `gSimani/ConcordBroker`
- Branch: `main`
- Root Directory: `/` (leave blank or set to `/`)
- Build Command: (leave blank - uses nixpacks.toml)
- Start Command: (leave blank - uses railway.json)

#### C. Trigger Deployment
1. Go to "Deployments" tab
2. Click "Redeploy" or "Deploy" button
3. Watch the build logs

## üìä Expected Build Output

You should see these messages in the build logs:
```
#1 [internal] load build definition
#2 detecting build configuration
#3 Found Python application
#4 Installing Python 3.10
#5 Installing pip packages from requirements.txt
#6 Build successful
#7 Starting application: python main.py
#8 Server running on port 8000
```

## üß™ Verify Deployment Success

Once deployed, test these endpoints:
1. Health Check: `https://your-app.up.railway.app/health`
2. Root: `https://your-app.up.railway.app/`
3. API Docs: `https://your-app.up.railway.app/docs`

## üîß Troubleshooting

### If Railway Still Only Sees README.md:

1. **Check Git Status**
   ```bash
   git status
   ```
   Make sure all new files are committed and pushed.

2. **Force Railway to Rebuild**
   - In Railway dashboard, go to Settings
   - Click "Clear Build Cache"
   - Trigger a new deployment

3. **Check Repository Connection**
   - Ensure Railway has access to your GitHub repo
   - Try disconnecting and reconnecting the repo

4. **Manual Deploy via CLI**
   ```bash
   railway login
   railway link
   railway up
   ```

### Common Error Fixes:

| Error | Solution |
|-------|----------|
| "No Python executable found" | Check PYTHON_VERSION env var is set to 3.10 |
| "Module not found" | Ensure requirements.txt has all dependencies |
| "Port already in use" | Make sure PORT env var is set |
| "Cannot import app" | Check main.py can import from apps/api |
| "Health check failing" | Verify /health endpoint returns 200 |

## üìù What Changed?

### Before (Complex):
- Railway couldn't find the Python app
- Complex nested directory structure
- Multiple configuration files conflicting

### After (Simple):
- `main.py` at root level - Railway can find it
- `requirements.txt` at root - Railway can see dependencies
- Simplified configuration - less chance for errors
- Fallback API included - guarantees something will run

## ‚úÖ Final Verification

Run this command to ensure everything is ready:
```bash
deploy-railway-fix.bat
```

This will:
1. Check all files exist
2. Verify Railway CLI is installed
3. Authenticate with Railway
4. Guide you through deployment

## üéâ Success Indicators

When it works, you'll see:
- ‚úÖ "Deployment successful" in Railway dashboard
- ‚úÖ Green status indicator
- ‚úÖ Public URL generated
- ‚úÖ Health checks passing
- ‚úÖ Logs showing "Server running on port 8000"

## Need Help?

If deployment still fails:
1. Screenshot the Railway build logs
2. Check which files Railway detected
3. Verify environment variables are set
4. Try the minimal test deployment first
