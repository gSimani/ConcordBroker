# Loading All 753,243 Broward County Properties

## Current Status
- You currently have 86,139 properties loaded
- The NAL file contains 753,243 total properties
- You need to load 667,104 more properties

## Option 1: Direct CSV Import (Fastest)

Instead of using Python scripts, you can import the CSV directly in Supabase:

1. Go to your Supabase dashboard
2. Navigate to the Table Editor
3. Click on `florida_parcels` table
4. Click "Import data from CSV"
5. Upload the `NAL16P202501.csv` file
6. Map the columns:
   - PARCEL_ID → parcel_id
   - OWN_NAME → owner_name
   - PHY_ADDR1 → phy_addr1
   - PHY_CITY → phy_city
   - PHY_ZIPCD → phy_zipcd
   - DOR_UC → property_use
   - TV_SD → taxable_value
   - JV → just_value
   - LND_VAL → land_value
   - ACT_YR_BLT → year_built
   - TOT_LVG_AREA → total_living_area
   - LND_SQFOOT → land_sqft

## Option 2: Use the Python Script

Run this command to load all properties:

```bash
python load_properties_efficient.py
```

This will:
- Load all 753,243 properties from the NAL file
- Show progress as it uploads
- Handle duplicates automatically
- Take approximately 20-30 minutes

## Option 3: Load Additional Data Files

You also have these files with additional data:
- `SDF16P202501.csv` - Sales data (can enrich existing properties)
- `NAP16P202501.csv` - Additional property data

## Why You Need All Properties

Having all 753,243 properties will enable:
1. Complete search across ALL Broward County
2. Better autocomplete (more addresses to search)
3. Comprehensive property filters
4. Full market analysis capabilities
5. Complete owner searches

## Current Database Structure

Your `florida_parcels` table has all necessary columns:
- Basic info (parcel_id, addresses, owner)
- Values (taxable, just, land)
- Property details (year_built, sqft, use codes)
- Sales information
- Data quality flags

## Next Steps After Loading

Once all properties are loaded:
1. Update property use codes for better filtering
2. Add indexes for faster searching
3. Enable full-text search on addresses
4. Set up regular data updates
