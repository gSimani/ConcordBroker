# Supabase Support Request - Bulk Data Upload Assistance

## Project Details
- **Project ID**: pmispwtdngkcmsrsjwbp
- **Project URL**: https://pmispwtdngkcmsrsjwbp.supabase.co
- **Database Password**: West@Boca613! (recently reset)
- **Table**: public.florida_parcels
- **Total Records to Upload**: 9,758,470 property records

## Current Situation

We need to upload 9.7 million Florida property appraiser records to our Supabase database. Currently, only **36.55% (3.5M records)** have been successfully uploaded. The remaining **6.2 million records** are failing due to connection and timeout issues.

## Issues Encountered

### 1. PostgreSQL Direct Connection - BLOCKED
- **Host**: db.pmispwtdngkcmsrsjwbp.supabase.co
- **Issue**: Host only resolves to IPv6 address (2600:1f18:2e13:9d1e:1be4:2e84:a39b:d518)
- **Error**: 'Network is unreachable' on Windows
- **Root Cause**: Windows cannot reach IPv6-only addresses

### 2. PostgreSQL Pooler Connection - BLOCKED
- **Host**: aws-0-us-east-1.pooler.supabase.com
- **User**: postgres.pmispwtdngkcmsrsjwbp
- **Port**: 6543
- **Error**: 'Tenant or user not found'
- **Note**: Password was reset to West@Boca613! but error persists

### 3. REST API - WORKING BUT LIMITED
- **Status**: Connected successfully with service role key
- **Limitation**: 2-minute statement timeout (error code 57014)
- **Impact**: Can only upload ~500 records per batch before timeout
- **Speed**: 10-100x slower than PostgreSQL COPY command

## What We Need

### Option 1: Enable Direct PostgreSQL Access (Preferred)
Can you provide ONE of the following:
1. **IPv4 address** for db.pmispwtdngkcmsrsjwbp.supabase.co
2. **Alternative hostname** that resolves to IPv4
3. **Guidance for Windows IPv6 connectivity** to your servers

### Option 2: Temporarily Disable Timeouts
For our bulk upload operation, can you:
1. **Disable statement_timeout** for our project temporarily
2. Or **increase timeout to 30 minutes** for bulk operations
3. Or **whitelist our connection** for extended operations

### Option 3: Bulk Upload Service
Do you offer any bulk upload service or tool that can:
1. Accept CSV files directly (we have 67 county CSV files)
2. Process them server-side without client timeouts
3. Or provide a dedicated upload endpoint

## Technical Details

### Data Structure
- **Files**: 67 CSV files (one per Florida county)
- **Size**: ~2.5 GB total
- **Format**: Standard CSV with headers
- **Records per file**: 8,000 to 958,000 records

### Upload Script Ready
We have a working Python script using:
- psycopg2 for PostgreSQL COPY (10-100x faster)
- Supabase Python client for REST API (working but slow)
- Retry logic and batch processing

## Questions

1. Can you provide an IPv4 address or alternative connection method?
2. Can you temporarily disable/increase timeouts for bulk upload?
3. Is there a recommended approach for uploading 10M+ records?
4. Can we schedule a brief call to resolve this quickly?

Thank you for your assistance!
