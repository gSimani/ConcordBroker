### Upload Summary
- **Completed Counties**: 36 (53.7%)
- **Partially Uploaded**: 4 (6.0%)
- **Not Started**: 27 (40.3%)

## Connection Issues Identified

### 1. PostgreSQL Direct Connection - FAILED ❌
- **Issue**: IPv6-only host (2600:1f18:2e13:9d1e:1be4:2e84:a39b:d518)
- **Error**: "Network is unreachable" on Windows
- **Root Cause**: Windows cannot reach IPv6 addresses directly
- **Attempted Solutions**:
  - Bracketed IPv6 literal: Failed
  - hostaddr parameter: Failed
  - Direct IPv6: Failed

### 2. PostgreSQL Pooler Connection - FAILED ❌
- **Issue**: Authentication error "Tenant or user not found"
- **Even After**: Password reset to West@Boca613!
- **Likely Cause**: Project-specific restrictions or pooler configuration

### 3. REST API with Service Role Key - WORKING ✅
- **Status**: Successfully connected
- **Limitations**: 
  - 2-minute statement timeout (code 57014)
  - Cannot use PostgreSQL COPY command
  - 10-100x slower than direct database access

## Recommended Solution

### Use Chunked REST API Upload with Service Role Key

```python
# Key configuration
SUPABASE_URL = "https://pmispwtdngkcmsrsjwbp.supabase.co"
SERVICE_ROLE_KEY = "eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9..."
BATCH_SIZE = 1000  # Small batches to avoid timeouts
MAX_RETRIES = 3
RETRY_DELAY = 2

# Process in chunks with retry logic
for county in missing_counties:
    upload_county_with_retry(county)
```

### Upload Strategy
1. **Batch Size**: 1000 records per request
2. **Retry Logic**: 3 attempts with exponential backoff
3. **Error Handling**: Skip and log timeout errors
4. **Progress Tracking**: Save state after each batch
5. **Parallel Processing**: Use async/await for multiple counties

## Next Steps

1. **Immediate**: Create chunked upload script with retry logic
2. **Run Upload**: Process remaining 6.2M records via REST API
3. **Monitor**: Track progress and handle timeouts gracefully
4. **Alternative**: Consider using a cloud VM with IPv4 connectivity for direct PostgreSQL access

## Time Estimate

With REST API approach:
- **Records to upload**: 6,191,726
- **Batch size**: 1000 records
- **Time per batch**: ~2 seconds
- **Total batches**: 6,192
- **Estimated time**: ~3.5 hours (with retries and errors)

## Contact Supabase Support

Request for production upload:
1. Temporarily disable statement_timeout for bulk upload
2. Provide IPv4 address for direct database access
3. Or provide guidance for Windows IPv6 connectivity
