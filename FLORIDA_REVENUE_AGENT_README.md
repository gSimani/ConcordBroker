      "data_type": "NAL",
      "filename": "Alachua 11 Preliminary NAL 2025.zip",
      "status": "success",
      "file_path": "C:\\...\\ALACHUA\\NAL\\NAL11P202501.csv",
      "timestamp": "2024-01-12T10:31:00"
    }
  ]
}
```

## Logging

Logs are saved to `florida_revenue_agent.log` with detailed information about:
- Navigation steps
- File discovery
- Download progress
- Extraction operations
- Error details

## Error Handling

The agent handles common issues:
- Network timeouts
- Missing files
- Invalid links
- Extraction failures
- Navigation errors

Failed downloads are logged and reported but don't stop the entire process.

## Performance

- Downloads files sequentially with 2-second delays
- Processes ~200 files in approximately 30-45 minutes
- Automatically extracts ZIP files and removes them
- Skips already downloaded files for efficient re-runs

## Troubleshooting

### Browser doesn't open
```bash
playwright install chromium
```

### Downloads fail
- Check internet connection
- Verify Florida Revenue website is accessible
- Review logs for specific error messages

### Files not organizing correctly
- Ensure base path exists and is writable
- Check county name mapping in agent code

## Manual Fallback

If automated download fails for specific files:

1. Open browser to the data page:
   - NAL: https://floridarevenue.com/.../NAL/2025P
   - NAP: https://floridarevenue.com/.../NAP/2025P  
   - SDF: https://floridarevenue.com/.../SDF/2025P

2. Download missing files manually

3. Place in correct folder structure:
   `DATABASE PROPERTY APP/COUNTY_NAME/DATA_TYPE/`

## Integration with Other Systems

This agent is designed to work with:
- Supabase database loaders
- Property data processing pipelines
- Tax analysis systems
- GIS mapping tools

## Maintenance

    DataType.NAL: ".../NAL/2026P",
    DataType.NAP: ".../NAP/2026P",
    DataType.SDF: ".../SDF/2026P"
}
```

### Add New Data Types
1. Add to DataType enum
2. Add URL to base_urls dict
3. Update file extraction logic if needed
