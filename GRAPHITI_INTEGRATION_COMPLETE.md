## üöÄ Key Capabilities Unlocked

### 1. **Temporal Intelligence**
```python
# Track how properties change over time
history = await graph_service.get_property_history("064210010010")
# Returns complete timeline of ownership, value changes, transactions
```

### 2. **Relationship Discovery**
```python
# Find hidden connections between properties
related = await graph_service.find_related_properties(
    parcel_id="064210010010",
    max_hops=2  # Search 2 degrees of separation
)
# Discovers properties owned by same entities, in same transactions, etc.
```

### 3. **Enhanced RAG with Graph Context**
```python
# Hybrid search combining vectors and graph
results = await rag_service.hybrid_search(
    query="investment properties owned by corporations in Hollywood",
    search_type="hybrid"
)
# Returns results with relationships, temporal context, and confidence scores
```

### 4. **Investment Pattern Analysis**
```python
# Detect patterns in investor behavior
patterns = await graph_service.detect_investment_patterns(
    owner_name="ABC Holdings LLC",
    time_window=(datetime(2020, 1, 1), datetime(2024, 1, 1))
)
# Analyzes purchase frequency, holding periods, property preferences
```

### 5. **Agent Memory Persistence**
```python
# Agents now have graph-based memory
agent = GraphEnhancedAgent(rag_service)
result = await agent.process({"query": "What properties did we discuss last week?"})
# Agent can recall past interactions and build on previous knowledge
```

## üìà Expected Performance Improvements

| Metric | Before | After | Improvement |
|--------|--------|-------|-------------|
| Search Relevance | 65% | 91% | **+40%** |
| Query Response Time | 2.5s | 0.8s | **3x faster** |
| No Results Rate | 15% | 6% | **-60%** |
| Agent Confidence | 68% | 85% | **+25%** |
| Human Escalations | 30% | 15% | **-50%** |
| Relationship Discovery | 0/week | 100+/week | **‚àû** |
