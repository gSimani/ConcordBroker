# Florida Property Appraiser Database Download - Status Report

## Summary
The Florida Property Appraiser NAL (Name, Address, Legal) database extraction has encountered several challenges:

1. **Florida Revenue Central Portal**: NAL files are not directly accessible via HTTP/HTTPS
2. **Broward County Property Appraiser**: Currently showing maintenance page
3. **No Direct FTP Access**: Unlike the Sunbiz database, property appraiser data doesn't have public FTP endpoints

## Download Attempts

### 1. Florida Revenue Data Portal (floridarevenue.com)
- **Status**: ❌ Failed
- **Issue**: NAL files not accessible via standard URLs
- **Tried Patterns**:
  - `/property/Documents/DataPortal/NAL/2025/`
  - `/FTP/NAL/2025P/`
  - Various other URL patterns
- **Result**: All returned 404 errors

### 2. Broward County Property Appraiser
- **Status**: ⚠️ Partial (Maintenance Mode)
- **Downloaded**: 1 file (PropertyData.zip - actually HTML maintenance page)
- **Issue**: GIS site is under maintenance
- **Alternative URLs Tried**:
  - bcpa.net/RecordSearch/downloads/
  - gis.broward.org/GISData/
  - bcpagis.broward.org/

## Files Created

### Scripts
1. `florida_property_appraiser_downloader.py` - Initial NAL downloader

## Directory Structure Created
```
C:\Users\gsima\Documents\MyProject\ConcordBroker\TEMP\DATABASE PROPERTY APP\
├── NAL_2025\              (empty - no files downloaded)
├── BROWARD\               
│   └── PropertyData.zip   (164KB - maintenance page HTML)
```

## Key Findings

1. **Access Restrictions**: Property appraiser data appears to require:
   - Special authentication
   - Manual navigation through portal
   - Possibly county-specific agreements

2. **Data Availability Varies by County**: Each county maintains its own system:
   - Some provide public downloads
   - Others require registration
   - Formats vary (CSV, DBF, TXT, shapefile)

3. **Alternative Approaches Needed**:
   - Contact Florida Department of Revenue directly
   - Use county-specific property appraiser websites
   - Consider using GIS services when available
   - May need to use web automation tools (Playwright/Selenium)

## Next Steps Recommended

1. **Manual Download**: Visit county property appraiser websites directly
2. **API Access**: Some counties provide REST APIs for property data
3. **Contact Officials**: Request bulk data access from Florida DOR
4. **Web Automation**: Use Playwright to navigate and download through web interfaces

## Comparison with Sunbiz Database

| Aspect | Sunbiz (Business) | Property Appraiser |
|--------|-------------------|-------------------|
| Access | Public SFTP | Limited/Restricted |
| Format | Fixed-width text | Various (CSV, DBF, etc) |
| Updates | Daily files | Varies by county |
| Centralized | Yes (state level) | No (county level) |
| Authentication | Anonymous | Often required |

## Conclusion

Unlike the Sunbiz business database which had direct SFTP access, the Florida Property Appraiser data requires a more complex approach:

1. **County-by-county downloads** rather than centralized access
2. **Web automation** may be necessary for some counties
3. **Manual intervention** might be required for authentication

The infrastructure is in place to process the data once obtained, but acquiring the raw NAL files requires addressing the access limitations first.
