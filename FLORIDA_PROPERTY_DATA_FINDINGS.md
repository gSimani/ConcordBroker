# Florida Property Data Download - Findings & Status

## Summary of Investigation

After extensive investigation into downloading Florida property appraiser data (NAL, NAP, NAV, SDF files), here are the key findings:

## 1. What We Successfully Accomplished

### ✅ Created Complete Folder Structure
- Created directories for all 67 Florida counties
- Each county has 4 subdirectories: NAL, NAP, NAV, SDF
- Location: `C:\Users\gsima\Documents\MyProject\ConcordBroker\TEMP\DATABASE PROPERTY APP\`

### ✅ Identified Data Portal Structure
- Using Playwright, we successfully navigated to the Florida Revenue data portal
- Found that NAL, NAP, NAV, and SDF folders exist on the website
- URL: https://floridarevenue.com/property/dataportal/

## 2. Challenges Encountered

### ❌ Direct HTTP Download
- Florida Revenue does not provide direct HTTP/HTTPS URLs for downloading files
- All attempted URL patterns returned 404 errors
- The site uses SharePoint which requires authentication for downloads

### ❌ FTP Server Access
- Attempted FTP servers did not resolve:
  - `sdrftp03.dor.state.fl.us` - DNS resolution failed
  - No public FTP server found for Florida Revenue property data

### ⚠️ Web Navigation Limitations
- The data portal requires manual navigation through multiple layers
- Files are behind authentication/session-based access
- No direct file links available even when navigating with Playwright

## 3. Data Access Methods That Work

Based on our investigation, here are the viable methods to obtain Florida property data:

### Option 1: Manual Download from Portal
1. Navigate to: https://floridarevenue.com/property/dataportal/
2. Click through to "Tax Roll Data Files"
3. Access each file type (NAL, NAP, NAV, SDF) folder
4. Download county files manually

### Option 2: County-Specific Sources
Many counties provide their own data downloads:
- **Broward**: https://web.bcpa.net/ (currently under maintenance)
- **Miami-Dade**: https://www.miamidade.gov/pa/
- **Palm Beach**: https://www.pbcgov.com/papa/

### Option 3: Official Data Request
Contact Florida Department of Revenue:
- Phone: 850-617-8300
- Request bulk data access or FTP credentials

## 4. Files Created During Investigation

### Scripts Created:
1. `florida_property_appraiser_downloader.py` - Initial downloader attempt
2. `florida_property_explorer.py` - Website structure explorer
3. `florida_nal_direct_downloader.py` - Direct URL attempts
4. `florida_revenue_navigator.py` - Playwright navigation
5. `florida_ftp_downloader.py` - FTP download attempt
6. `broward_property_downloader.py` - County-specific downloader

### Documentation:
1. `PROPERTY_APPRAISER_DOWNLOAD_PROCESS.md`
2. `PROPERTY_APPRAISER_STATUS.md`
3. `FLORIDA_PROPERTY_DATA_FINDINGS.md` (this file)

## 5. Directory Structure Created

```
C:\Users\gsima\Documents\MyProject\ConcordBroker\TEMP\DATABASE PROPERTY APP\
├── ALACHUA\
│   ├── NAL\
│   ├── NAP\
│   ├── NAV\
│   └── SDF\
├── BAKER\
│   ├── NAL\
│   ├── NAP\
│   ├── NAV\
│   └── SDF\
├── BAY\
│   ├── NAL\
│   ├── NAP\
│   ├── NAV\
│   └── SDF\
... (64 more counties with same structure)
```

## 6. Chain of Thought Process

### Initial Approach:
1. ✅ Created folder structure for organization
2. ✅ Explored website structure with WebFetch
3. ❌ Attempted direct URL patterns
4. ✅ Used Playwright to navigate site
5. ❌ Tried FTP server connection
6. ✅ Documented findings

### What Worked:
- Playwright successfully navigated the site and identified folder structure
- Created complete organizational structure for data storage
- Identified that data exists but requires authenticated access

### What Didn't Work:
- Direct HTTP downloads (no public URLs)
- FTP server access (server doesn't resolve)
- Automated bulk downloading without authentication

## 7. Recommendations

### For Immediate Access:
1. **Use Playwright with authentication** - Enhance the navigator script to handle login
2. **Contact Florida DOR** - Request official FTP access or bulk download
3. **Focus on specific counties** - Start with counties that provide public downloads

### For Long-term Solution:
1. **Obtain official API/FTP access** from Florida Department of Revenue
2. **Set up automated scraping** with proper authentication
3. **Consider purchasing commercial data feed** if available

## 8. Comparison with Sunbiz Database

| Aspect | Sunbiz (Business) | Property Appraiser |
|--------|-------------------|-------------------|
| **Access Method** | Public SFTP | Restricted Web Portal |
| **Authentication** | Anonymous | Required |
| **File Format** | Fixed-width text | Various (DBF, CSV, TXT) |
| **Automation** | ✅ Fully automated | ❌ Manual/Semi-automated |
| **Updates** | Daily files available | Varies by county |

## 9. Next Steps

To successfully download the Florida property data, you need to:

1. **Obtain Credentials**: Contact Florida DOR for official access
2. **Manual Download**: Use the created folder structure and manually download files
3. **Enhance Automation**: Add authentication to Playwright script
4. **Alternative Sources**: Use county-specific websites where available

## Conclusion

While we successfully:
- ✅ Created the complete folder structure
- ✅ Identified where the data exists
- ✅ Built multiple download scripts
- ✅ Documented the entire process

The actual data download requires either:
- Manual intervention through the web portal
- Official credentials from Florida Department of Revenue
- County-by-county approach using local property appraiser sites

The infrastructure is ready - we just need the access method to complete the download.
