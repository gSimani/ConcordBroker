## 🎯 Deploy to Railway Now

### Step 1: Run Deployment Script

**Double-click this file:**
```
DEPLOY_NOW.bat
```

Or run in terminal:
```bash
DEPLOY_NOW.bat
```

### Step 2: Follow the Prompts

The script will:
1. ✅ Open browser for Railway login
2. ⏳ Deploy Meilisearch
3. ⏳ Deploy Search API
4. ⏳ Configure environment variables
5. ⏳ Generate public URLs

**Save your URLs when the script shows them!**

## After Deployment (3 Simple Steps)

### 1. Index Properties to Railway (2-3 minutes)

Edit `apps/api/railway_indexer.py` line 12:
```python
MEILI_URL = 'https://YOUR-MEILISEARCH-URL.up.railway.app'
```

Then run:
```bash
cd apps/api
python railway_indexer.py 100000
```

### 2. Update Frontend (5 minutes)

Edit `apps/web/src/pages/properties/PropertySearch.tsx`:

Add at top:
```typescript
const SEARCH_API_URL = 'https://YOUR-SEARCH-API-URL.up.railway.app';
```

Replace Supabase count query with:
```typescript
const getPropertyCount = async (filters: any) => {
  const response = await fetch(`${SEARCH_API_URL}/search/count`, {
    method: 'POST',
    headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' },
    body: JSON.stringify({ filters })
  });
  const { count } = await response.json();
  return count;
};
```

### 3. Test It (2 minutes)

```bash
cd apps/web
npm run dev
```

Navigate to PropertySearch, apply Building SqFt filter (10K-20K).

**Result: Should show 964 (not 7.3M!)** ✅
