# Property Appraiser Database Audit Report

**Date:** 2025-09-16
**Database:** Supabase (mogulpssjdlxjvstqfee.supabase.co)
**MCP Server:** Healthy and Connected

## Executive Summary

The audit reveals that the Property Appraiser database infrastructure is **NOT deployed** to production. While the schema definitions exist in the codebase, no actual database tables have been created in Supabase.

## Current Database Status

### Tables Expected vs Found

| nal_assessments | Names/addresses | ❌ NOT FOUND |
| nap_characteristics | Property characteristics | ❌ NOT FOUND |
| nav_values | Property values | ❌ NOT FOUND |
| sdf_sales | Sales data | ❌ NOT FOUND |
| **Supporting Tables** | | |
| properties | Unified property table | ❌ NOT FOUND |
| property_values | Historical values | ❌ NOT FOUND |
| sales_history | Transaction records | ❌ NOT FOUND |
| tax_certificates | Tax certificate data | ❌ NOT FOUND |
| tax_deed_sales | Tax deed auction data | ❌ NOT FOUND |
| florida_business_entities | Business ownership | ❌ NOT FOUND |

| building_permits | Permit data | ❌ NOT FOUND |

**Total Tables Found:** 0 / 13

## Schema Analysis

### Expected florida_parcels Schema (from supabase_schema.sql)

The codebase contains a comprehensive schema definition with the following structure:

#### Core Fields (NAL Data Mapping)
- `parcel_id` - Primary identifier
- `county` - County name (67 Florida counties)
- `year` - Tax year (2025)
- `land_sqft` - Mapped from LND_SQFOOT
- `phy_addr1/phy_addr2` - Physical address
- `owner_addr1/owner_addr2` - Owner address
- `owner_state` - 2-char state code
- `just_value` - Market value (from JV)
- `land_value` - Land assessment
- `building_value` - Improvement value
- `sale_date` - Latest sale (YYYY-MM-01 format)

#### Additional Fields
- Geometry data (GeoJSON format)
- Property characteristics (bedrooms, bathrooms, square footage)
- Legal descriptions
- Zoning and land use codes
- Data quality flags

### Expected Indexes

The schema defines critical performance indexes:
1. `(parcel_id, county, year)` - Unique constraint
2. County-based lookups
3. Owner name searches
4. Address queries
5. Value range filters
6. Sale date/price queries
7. Spatial (GeoJSON) queries

## Data Flow Architecture (Not Operational)

### Intended Data Routing

```
Florida Revenue Portal
         ↓
[NAL, NAP, NAV, SDF Files]
         ↓
florida_parcels table
         ↓
    ┌────┴────┐
    ↓         ↓
properties  sales_history
    ↓         ↓
  Web UI   Analytics
```

### Current Status: All Routes Broken
- ❌ Property Appraiser → Properties
- ❌ Sales History → Properties
- ❌ Tax Deed → Properties
- ❌ Business Entities → Properties

## Critical Issues Identified

### 1. No Database Tables Exist
- The Supabase instance has no Property Appraiser tables
- Schema files exist in codebase but haven't been deployed
- No data migration has occurred

### 2. Data Source Expectations
Per CLAUDE.md, the system expects:
- 9.7 million Florida property records
- Data from 67 counties
- Files located at `TEMP\DATABASE PROPERTY APP\{COUNTY}\{TYPE}\*.csv`
- Types: NAL, NAP, NAV, SDF

### 3. Upload Process Not Configured
The system requires:
- Pre-upload: CREATE_INDEXES.sql
- Timeout removal: APPLY_TIMEOUTS_NOW.sql
- Batch upload with SERVICE_ROLE_KEY
- Post-upload: REVERT_TIMEOUTS_AFTER.sql

## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions Required

1. **Deploy Database Schema**
   ```sql
   -- Run apps/api/supabase_schema.sql in Supabase SQL Editor
   ```

2. **Create Required Indexes**
   ```sql
   -- Run CREATE_INDEXES.sql for performance
   ```

3. **Load Property Appraiser Data**
   - Verify data files exist in expected location
   - Run data loader with proper column mappings
   - Use batch size: 1000, parallel workers: 4

4. **Verify Data Integrity**
   - Check for null parcel_ids
   - Validate county names (uppercase)
   - Ensure year = 2025 for current data
   - Verify state codes are 2 characters

### Long-term Improvements

1. **Monitoring System**
   - Daily checks at 2 AM EST for Florida Revenue updates
   - File change detection for all 67 counties
   - Checksum validation

2. **Performance Optimization**
   - Implement table partitioning by county
   - Add materialized views for common queries
   - Configure connection pooling

3. **Data Quality**
   - Implement validation rules
   - Add data lineage tracking
   - Create audit logs for changes

## MCP Server Integration Status

✅ MCP Server is healthy and operational
✅ Supabase connection is configured
❌ No Property Appraiser data tables to query
❌ REST endpoints return 401 (no tables exist)

## Next Steps

1. **Create Tables**: Execute supabase_schema.sql in Supabase dashboard
2. **Load Data**: Run florida data loader scripts
3. **Verify**: Re-run this audit after deployment
4. **Monitor**: Set up daily sync with Florida Revenue portal
