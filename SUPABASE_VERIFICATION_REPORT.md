## üìã SQL Queries for Supabase Support

Please run these queries to verify and diagnose:

```sql
-- 1. TOTAL COUNT VERIFICATION
SELECT COUNT(*) as total_rows FROM public.florida_parcels;
-- Expected: Should show ~3.5M and growing

-- 2. CHECK ACTIVE COPY OPERATIONS
SELECT pid, datname, relid::regclass as relation, command, type, 
       bytes_processed, pg_size_pretty(bytes_processed) as bytes_processed_pretty,
       bytes_total, pg_size_pretty(bytes_total) as bytes_total_pretty,
       round(100.0 * bytes_processed / nullif(bytes_total,0), 2) as pct
FROM pg_stat_progress_copy
ORDER BY pid;

-- 3. DETAILED COUNTY DISTRIBUTION
SELECT county, COUNT(*) as rows
FROM public.florida_parcels
GROUP BY county
ORDER BY rows DESC;

-- 4. CHECK FOR DUPLICATE RECORDS (explaining over-counts)
SELECT county, parcel_id, COUNT(*) as duplicate_count
FROM public.florida_parcels
GROUP BY county, parcel_id
HAVING COUNT(*) > 1
ORDER BY duplicate_count DESC
LIMIT 20;

-- 5. TABLE SIZE AND GROWTH
SELECT 
    schemaname,
    tablename,
    pg_size_pretty(pg_total_relation_size(schemaname||'.'||tablename)) AS size,
    n_live_tup as estimated_rows,
    n_tup_ins as rows_inserted,
    n_tup_upd as rows_updated,
    n_tup_del as rows_deleted
FROM pg_stat_user_tables
WHERE tablename = 'florida_parcels';

-- 6. CHECK FOR BLOCKING LOCKS
SELECT 
    blocking.pid AS blocking_pid,
    blocking.usename AS blocking_user,
    blocked.query AS blocked_query
FROM pg_locks blocked_locks
JOIN pg_stat_activity blocked ON blocked.pid = blocked_locks.pid
JOIN pg_locks blocking_locks ON blocking_locks.pid != blocked_locks.pid
    AND blocking_locks.granted
WHERE NOT blocked_locks.granted;

-- 7. RECENT ACTIVITY
SELECT 
    query_start,
    state,
    wait_event_type,
    wait_event,
    query
FROM pg_stat_activity
WHERE datname = current_database()
    AND query ILIKE '%florida_parcels%'
ORDER BY query_start DESC
LIMIT 10;
```

## üöÄ Recommended Actions

### For Supabase Support:

1. **Verify Staging Table Creation**:
```sql
-- Check if staging table exists
SELECT EXISTS (
    SELECT 1 FROM information_schema.tables 
    WHERE table_schema = 'public' 
    AND table_name = 'florida_parcels_staging'
);

-- If not, create it
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS florida_parcels_staging (
    LIKE florida_parcels INCLUDING ALL
);
```

2. **Set Session Parameters for Bulk Loading**:
```sql
-- For the loading session
SET statement_timeout = 0;
SET lock_timeout = 0;
SET synchronous_commit = off;
SET client_min_messages = warning;
SET work_mem = '256MB';
SET maintenance_work_mem = '512MB';
```

3. **Monitor View Creation**:
```sql
CREATE OR REPLACE VIEW public.florida_parcels_ingest_status
WITH (security_invoker=on) AS
SELECT 
    county,
    COUNT(*) as total_rows,
    MAX(import_date) as last_insert_at,
    COUNT(DISTINCT parcel_id) as unique_parcels
FROM public.florida_parcels
GROUP BY county;

-- Grant access
GRANT SELECT ON public.florida_parcels_ingest_status TO authenticated, anon;
```

## üîß Connection Requirements

### Critical: Direct Database Connection Needed
- **DO NOT use JWT as password** - it's an authentication token, not a database password
- **Need actual PostgreSQL password** from Database Settings
- **Use direct connection** (not pooler) for COPY operations:
  ```
  postgresql://postgres.[project-ref]:[actual-db-password]@db.[project-ref].supabase.co:5432/postgres
  ```
- **Or add** `?pgbouncer=false` to connection string

### For psycopg COPY Implementation:
```python
import psycopg
from psycopg import sql

# Use DIRECT connection, not pooler
conn_string = "postgresql://postgres.[ref]:[password]@db.[ref].supabase.co:5432/postgres"

with psycopg.connect(conn_string) as conn:
    # Set session parameters
    with conn.cursor() as cur:
        cur.execute("SET statement_timeout = 0")
        cur.execute("SET synchronous_commit = off")
        
    # Use COPY for bulk loading
    with conn.cursor() as cur:
        with open('county_data.csv', 'r') as f:
            cur.copy_expert(
                sql="COPY florida_parcels_staging FROM STDIN WITH CSV HEADER",
                file=f
            )
```

## üìà Expected Timeline

With proper COPY implementation:
- **Remaining 6.2M records** should load in 2-4 hours
- Current rate appears to be ~300K records/hour
- At current rate: ~20 more hours needed
- With optimized COPY: Could complete in 2-4 hours

## ‚ùì Questions for Supabase Support

1. Can you confirm if there's an active COPY operation running?
2. Are there any statement timeouts still affecting the uploads?
3. Can you provide the direct database password for COPY operations?
4. Should we investigate the duplicate records in BROWARD, DUVAL, and MARION?
5. Is there a maximum row limit or quota that might affect loading?

## üìû Next Steps

1. **Immediate**: Run verification queries above
2. **Provide**: Direct database connection credentials
3. **Confirm**: No active timeouts or locks blocking inserts
4. **Monitor**: Use pg_stat_progress_copy to track COPY progress
5. **Optimize**: Apply recommended session settings

*This report shows significant progress but indicates that optimized bulk loading is still needed to complete the remaining 63% of data efficiently.*
